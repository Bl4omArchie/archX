        <p>
            I'm a 21 year old french student interested in cybersecurity, cryptography and many other stuff. I'm currently in mine third and last year of a Bachelor in computer science.
            <br/><br/>
            
            I had my first computer at 13 and I had no idea what I was doing at the time. I simply enjoyed the fact that you can build almost anything with a programming language and then I started with python and later the C language.
            I really got interested in cybersecurity through CTF and cryptography. <br/><br/>
            Most of my time I'm thinking more than developing, this is probably why I don't finish so much my coding project! But I like to read papers and improve my understanding of computers and its science. 
            I've also been diagnosed asperger a few years ago now.

            The purpose of this blog is to group resources I'm finding. It is like a summary of my experience, what helped me and things I want to share. 
            You also can find articles and write-up that I wrote and a library that I'm maintaining with a lot of interesting books and papers.
        </p>

            Note: everything here is in english but if you find this flag: ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡· It means that the document is in french !
            Finally If I'm using the word crypto anywhere, I mean cryptography and not cryptocurrency!
