                <a href="https://github.com/openssl/openssl" target="_blank">OpenSSL</a>
                is a robust, commercial-grade, full-featured Open Source Toolkit for the TLS (formerly SSL), DTLS and QUIC (currently client side only) protocols.
                The documentation isn't the best but you can use openSSL's library to include header like BigNum, AES, RSA and have fun with it.

                A self-contained cryptographic library for Python. I think this open source repository is the best for beginners to make their first contribution.
                Issues are easy to understand, the project isn't big compare to openSSL and you can have a good overview of the whole project.

                <a href="https://github.com/Mbed-TLS/mbedtls" target="_blank">MbedTLS</a>
                An open source, portable, easy to use, readable and flexible TLS library, and reference implementation of the PSA Cryptography API.
                The documentation is way better than OpenSSL so you can more easily understand the library and code with it.

                is a repository maintained by Jean-Philippe Aumasson, a great cryptographer. It lists "coding rules" for implementations of cryptographic operations, and more generally for operations involving secret or sensitive values. 
                This page is a very good ressource if you want to develop your own implementation. Of course those recommendations aren't enought for a well secured implementation but as a beginner it is a good training.

                The Community Cryptography Specification Project is a project that facilitates the maintenance of cryptography specifications using software development methodologies. In other words, C2SP applies the successful processes of open source software development and maintenance to specification documents.

                is a peer2peer protocol that share data between several machines in live. With encryption, serializaion of the data and more you can easily build an application based on this protocol like alternative to Youtube, Zoom or Facebook.     
                The protocol is implemented in JS and you can integrate it easily in your HTML with CDNs headers or directly in your JS code.
