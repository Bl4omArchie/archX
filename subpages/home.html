    ArchX - Cryptography and computing
</p>
<h1>
    Welcome to archX !
</h1>
<p>
    I'm a 21 year old french student interested in cybersecurity, cryptography and many other stuff. I'm currently in mine third and last year of a Bachelor in computer science.
    
    <br/><br/> I had my first computer at 13 and I had no idea what I was doing at the time. I simply enjoyed the fact that you can build almost anything with a programming language and then I started with python and later the C language.
    I really got interested in cybersecurity through CTF and cryptography.

    <br/><br/> Most of my time I'm thinking more than developing, this is probably why I don't finish so much my coding project! But I like to read papers and improve my understanding of computers and its science. 
    
    <br/><br/> I've also been diagnosed asperger a few years ago now.

    <br/><br/> The purpose of this blog is to group resources I'm finding. It is like a summary of my experience, what helped me and things I want to share. 
    You also can find articles and write-up that I wrote and a library that I'm maintaining with a lot of interesting books and papers.
    
    <br/><br/> Note: everything here is in english but if you find this flag: <img class="flag-fr" src="../img/france_flag.svg" alt="ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·"> It means that the document is in french !
    Finally If I'm using the word crypto anywhere, I mean cryptography and not cryptocurrency!
