            <p class="list-item-description">
                is a robust, commercial-grade, full-featured Open Source Toolkit for the TLS
                (formerly SSL), DTLS and QUIC (currently client side only) protocols.
                The documentation isn't the best but you can use openSSL's library to include header like BigNum, AES, RSA
                and have fun with it.

            <p class="list-item-description">
                A self-contained cryptographic library for Python. I think this open source
                repository is the best for beginners to make their first contribution.
                Issues are easy to understand, the project isn't big compare to openSSL and you can have a good overview of
                the whole project.

                An open source, portable, easy to use, readable and flexible TLS library, and
                reference implementation of the PSA Cryptography API.
                The documentation is way better than OpenSSL so you can more easily understand the library and code with it.

                is an open source cryptography company building state-of-the-art FHE (Fully
                Homomorphic Encryption) solutions for blockchain and AI. The project is interesting because it introduces
                you to FHE and have a bounty program so if your are good and motivated you even can make a bit of money.

                is a repository maintained by Jean-Philippe Aumasson, a great cryptographer. It
                lists "coding rules" for implementations of cryptographic operations, and more generally for operations
                involving secret or sensitive values.
                This page is a very good ressource if you want to develop your own implementation. Of course those
                recommendations aren't enought for a well secured implementation but as a beginner it is a good training.

                is a peer2peer protocol that share data between several machines in live. With
                encryption, serializaion of the data and more you can easily build an application based on this protocol
                like alternative to Youtube, Zoom or Facebook.
                The protocol is implemented in JS and you can integrate it easily in your HTML with CDNs headers or directly
                in your JS code.
